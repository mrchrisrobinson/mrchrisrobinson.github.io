            I am an avid reader. My booklist is organized by categories. Soon I hope to add a reviews section.

            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Demo-Stunning-Software-Demonstrations/dp/059534559X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1505190806&sr=8-1&keywords=great+demo">
            "Great Demo!" by Peter Cohan</a><br />
            This book is a <strong>MUST</strong> for anybody who is regularly doing any type of presentations especially <em>Sales</em> demos. If you implemen the suggestions in this book you will probably get a promotion.<br />
            <br />
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1505190851&sr=8-1&keywords=on+writing+well">
            "On Writing Well" by William Zinsser</a><br />
            If you find yourself writing regularly, then this book will blow your mind while making your writing more concise, personal and readable. For some reason I expected the book to be a dry read, but it is written so well that it is hard to put down.<br />
            <br />
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118871642/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1505187957&sr=8-2&keywords=html+and+css">
            "HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites" by Jon Duckett</a><br />
            This is the first programming book that I have ever seen that is actually well laid out with easily accessable information. My only critique is that it should come spriral bound with tabs for each section. Tha is how often I filp through it.<br />
            <br />
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Challenger-Sale-Control-Customer-Conversation/dp/1591844355/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1505188060&sr=1-1&keywords=challenger+sale">
            "THe Challenger Sale" by Matthew Dixon, Brent Adamson </a><br />
            This sales methedology works well for a Sales Engineer who has to propose replacing an existing solution be it an ERP, app developement platform or CRM. This book outlines how to effectively propose your own solution in the face of competition or existing solutions.<br />
