            Sales Engineer Manifesto
        </h1>
        <p2>
            I am a Sales Engineer, one of the most valuable and underutilized resources at any company. How is a Sales Engineer valuable?<br /> 
            This is obvious to anyone who has had the pleasure of working with a professional Sales Engineer;<br /> 
            by increasing win rates and sales velocity of your sales team,<br /> 
            by correctly articulating the value of your solution to the customer,<br /> 
            by working with the product team to develope features your customers will pay for,<br />
            and by ultimately raising the ASP (Average Selling Price) of your solution.<br />
            <br />
            This lifecycle that I can bring to a company that has not implemted a Sales Engineer department has obvious value, but the value does not stop there.<br />
            Sales Engineers can help all of these departments:<br />
            <strong>Sales:</strong> Demo, Proof of Concept, Technical Q &amp; A, Training, Sys Opps for Product/Accounting environments<br />
            <strong>Marketing:</strong> Conferences, Canned Demos, Webinars, SME White Papers, Thought Leadership, Answers to forum questions<br />
            <strong>Product Marketing:</strong> Relevant messaging, Business analysis on competitors<br /> 
            <strong>Channel:</strong> Enablement, Training<br />
            <strong>CS:</strong> Save escalations, Train “CS Engineer” for backup demo and upsell/cross sell demos<br />
            <strong>Product Management:</strong> Voice of the Prospect program (helps AEs know what messaging is working), Feature interaction and flows, Presales Customizations<br />

            All of these activities can be directly linked back to revenue generating activities.<br />
            Now do you see the value of a Sales Engineer?
